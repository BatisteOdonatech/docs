## Overview

The game logging system allows you to record matches between players with automatic ELO calculation and statistics tracking. All games must be logged by authenticated users.

## Game types

The application supports three game formats:

### 1v1 (Singles)

Classic one-on-one matches between two players.

- Two players total
- Direct head-to-head competition
- Standard ELO calculation

### 2v1 (Handicap)

One player faces a team of two players.

- Three players total
- Special ELO modifiers apply:
  - Solo player wins: 2× ELO gain for solo, 0.5× loss for each duo player
  - Duo wins: 0.5× ELO gain for each duo player, 1× loss for solo

### 2v2 (Doubles)

Team-based matches with two players per side.

- Four players total
- Team average ELO used for calculations
- Both teammates receive the same ELO change

## Logging a game

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to log game page">
Go to `/log-game` or click "Log game" in the navigation.
</Step>

<Step title="Select game type">
Choose between 1v1, 2v1, or 2v2 using the dropdown selector.
</Step>

<Step title="Enter player names">
Type player names for each team position. The system will:
- Auto-suggest existing players
- Create new players automatically if names don't exist
- Validate that all required positions are filled
</Step>

<Step title="Enter scores">
Input the final score for each team:
- Scores must be between 0 and 10
- One team must have exactly 10 points (winning score)
- The other team must have less than 10 points
</Step>

<Step title="Submit the game">
Click "Log game" to record the match. The system will:
- Validate all inputs
- Calculate ELO changes
- Update player statistics
- Record the game in history
</Step>
</Steps>

## Score validation

The application enforces these rules:

- Winning team must score exactly 10 points
- Losing team must score between 0 and 9 points
- Scores cannot be negative
- One team must win (no ties)

## Special modifiers

### 10-0 shutout bonus

Perfect victories receive a 1.5× multiplier on ELO changes:

```
Base ELO change: +15
With shutout bonus: +15 × 1.5 = +23
```

This rewards dominant performances and penalizes complete defeats.

### 2v1 adjustments

When a solo player faces a duo, the ELO distribution is adjusted to maintain fairness:

**Solo player wins:**
- Solo player: 2× normal ELO gain
- Each duo player: 0.5× normal ELO loss

**Duo wins:**
- Each duo player: 0.5× normal ELO gain
- Solo player: 1× normal ELO loss

This balances the inherent difficulty of playing alone against two opponents.

## Player creation

Players are created automatically when logging games:

- **Starting ELO**: 1200 (configurable)
- **Initial stats**: 0 games, 0 wins, 0 losses
- **Name validation**: Alphanumeric characters, spaces, hyphens, and underscores only
- **Max length**: 50 characters

## Game history

All logged games are stored with:

- Player names and IDs
- Team compositions
- Final scores
- Winner designation
- ELO changes for each player
- Timestamp
- User who recorded the game

View game history on the `/games` page with detailed ELO breakdowns.

## Error handling

The system validates:

- User authentication (must be signed in)
- Player name format and length
- Score validity
- Game type consistency
- Database constraints

Common errors:

- **"Authentication required"**: Sign in with Clerk
- **"Invalid score"**: Check that winner has 10 points
- **"Invalid player name"**: Use only allowed characters
- **"Game type mismatch"**: Verify player count matches game type

## Best practices

<Tip>
**Accurate logging**: Always verify player names and scores before submitting to maintain data integrity.
</Tip>

<Warning>
**No editing**: Games cannot be edited after submission. Double-check all details before logging.
</Warning>

<Note>
**Player names**: Use consistent naming (e.g., "John" vs "john" creates two different players).
</Note>
